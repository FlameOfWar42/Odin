Odin is a forge mod for Hypixel Skyblock on the minecraft version 1.8.9. The mod specializes in Kuudra & Dungeons and offers a bunch of additional features for all parts of Hypixel Skyblock. The mod is also designed to be as lightweight as possible to ensure that it does not impact the game's performance.

The mod contains two versions which are two separate builds. Utilizing Gradle MultiProject functionality enables us to develop two separate versions of the mod within the same repository while keeping the unique additions to each version separate. If you have any questions regarding the mod, please feel free to ask in the Discord server.

To open the main menu use `/od`, `/odin` or `/odinclient` in chat.
For extensive command help use `/od help` in chat.

We have an installation guide which you can access clicking [here](https://odtheking.github.io/Odin/installation_guide).

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome, please use the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2nCbC9hkxT) for that.

SubAddons is a fork of odin including various features unable to go into normal odin. SubAddons attempts to provide updated nightly releases of odin in their most stable state, resulting in less frequent updates but a greater gurantee in quality than that of official odin nightly builds.
If you do not know how to install, and are not in the discord, I will not be providing instruction. Access to the discord is private, however releases are not. 

Features include, but are not limited to:

AntiLowball: Automatically reports lowballers, with options to hide all functions, or change the style of messages.

Player Highlight: Highlights players based on team.

Rat Protection: Prevents the user from being logged while online.

Various Other Settings: Cancelling wrong clicks on legit, blocking etherwarp to certain waypoints (With an option for compatibility with Funny Map Extras), SBE blood fix, and more.

For bug reports, suggestions, and anything else unrelated to installation, please contact SubAt0mic on discord BEFORE the authors of Odin.
